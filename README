Install rhodes:

  gem install rhodes

Install rhosync: http://wiki.rhomobile.com/index.php/RhoSync

Download and run store-server: http://github.com/rhomobile/store-server

Now, edit the rhoconfig.txt file in this application. Set "syncserver" to the correct IP address for your running store-server. In the example below, the store-server is running at 192.168.1.220 on port 9292.

syncserver = 'http://192.168.1.220:9292/application/'

This application syncs data with http://rhostore.heroku.com. To keep things simple, you do not need a login to access that site. 

To build this application, for example, on BlackBerry type: rake run:bb, or rake run:iphone for iPhone.
